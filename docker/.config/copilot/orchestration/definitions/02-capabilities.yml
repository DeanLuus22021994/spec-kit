# Subagent capability matrix
capability_matrix:
  strengths:
    parallel_execution:
      description: "Batch 5-10 independent tool calls simultaneously"
      optimal_use: "Data gathering, file searches, grep operations"
      performance_gain: "2-3x speedup vs sequential"

    focused_execution:
      description: "No conversation history = no context switching"
      optimal_use: "Single-purpose validation tasks"
      anti_pattern: "Multi-step debugging sessions"

    structured_processing:
      description: "Raw tool output → formatted reports"
      optimal_use: "Validation reports, metrics aggregation"
      output_formats: ["json", "markdown", "yaml"]

    repetitive_validation:
      description: "Same check pattern across multiple targets"
      optimal_use: "Linting, schema validation, config checks"
      fatigue_resistant: true

  weaknesses:
    contextual_decisions:
      description: "Cannot access conversation history"
      mitigation: "Include context snapshot in prompt"
      max_context_lines: 10

    user_intent:
      description: "Cannot interpret ambiguous requests"
      mitigation: "Primary agent preprocesses request"

    iterative_debugging:
      description: "Stateless between invocations"
      mitigation: "Use primary agent for debug loops"
      max_iterations: 1

    creative_solutions:
      description: "Follows predefined patterns only"
      mitigation: "Primary agent innovates, subagent executes"
